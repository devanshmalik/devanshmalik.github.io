title: My Path to 'Option B'
---

This is my first blogpost outlining my journey as to why I decided to start a blog about my data analysis projects.

## How did I get here?

I'm currently enrolled in Electrical Engineering (EE) at the University of Waterloo and am entering fourth year starting May 2018. Prior to switching to EE, I studied Software Engineering for two years where I lacked the passion for core software development roles. Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) which still allowed me to pursue software but expanded the course work to include both hardware and a greater mathematics focus. In my previous internship in summer 2017, I tried embedded hardware development which was a great learning experience but I felt that the job was missing a real-life component as I couldn't see an immediate impact of my work.

## Why data analytics?

I had heard about the growing field of data science but had never researched the day to day life of individuals within it. After preliminary research, things that struck out to me regarding data science roles were:

- **Problem Solving** : Most roles revolve around the need to solve a certain business problem through use of data
- **Communication** : Strong communication skills were required to convey data driven insights to business stakeholders and convince them of validity of your results
- **Technical Knowledge** : Aptitude to learn and use programming languages and tools best suited for the problem at hand

I purposely put technical knowledge last because programming languages are mere tools which continually change but problem solving and communication skills are constant. I have always been drawn towards numbers and trying to make sense of them. From being a fantasy baseball and basketball addict to analyzing poker hand odds, I was naturally drawn towards this sector.

## Round 1

In July 2017, I enrolled myself in Coursera MOOCs focused on data analysis using Excel and SQL and communication of insights using Tableau. I felt that the knowledge gained was useful but the courses lacked projects for the application of concepts learned.

I went back to school in September to finish third year and took databases course focusing on database management including data extraction through SQL. It also involved a data mining [project](https://github.com/Beezlie/Yelp-Dataset-Analysis) using [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.ca/dataset)  where we tried to predict what rating an arbitrary user would give an arbitrary business. I did not know the math behind specific machine learning algorithms but based on our research, random forest algorithm suited the parameters of the problem well. Despite the lack of understanding of algorithms, it felt great to perform predictive analysis and further motivated me to pursue a deeper understanding of these topics.

## Round 2 _(Ongoing)_

In January 2018, I began my internship as a Customer Innovation Analyst at Northbridge Insurance in hopes of further expanding my skill set. In addition to improving my Excel analysis and reporting technical skills, I'm improving both written and oral communication skills which are extremely important especially within data science roles. My innovation team is constantly creating reports and decks which are presented to the company management. Thus, I'm learning how to tell stories with data to a non-technical audience by condensing technical information into plain language. At the time of writing this blog post, I'm three months into my internship and hope to continue learning until I go back to school in May 2018.

## Why Udacity and Why Data Analyst Nanodegree?

**Why Udacity** : PROJECTS! As mentioned, my previous MOOCs experience was lacking due to the inability to actively apply the concepts taught. I picked Udacity due to the project-based learning experience offered.

**Why Data Analyst Nanodegree** : I chose this nanodegree instead of delving directly into advanced data science topics such as machine learning because my primary goal is to be comfortable with the data analysis process. This helps develop stronger fundamentals including data wrangling, analyzing and communicating allowing for an easier transition into advanced techniques. Furthermore, this nanodegree is in collaboration with Kaggle, Tableau and Mode who are industry leaders in the analytics space ensuring that the curriculum provides most cutting-edge skills.

## Why a personal blog?

Most experts in the data science field have a personal blog outlining their projects, problem approach, data analysis and finally interpretation of results. Thus, I decided to blog each project undertaken to improve my communication skills to effectively explain my approach and results to both a technical and non-technical audience.
